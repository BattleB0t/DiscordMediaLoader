## How to use
First things first: **Do not use if you have MFA enabled** as long as login is only supported via username and password. That might get you lost your account. A switch to a token based login will come soonâ„¢!

Otherwise you may just do the following steps:
 1. Login
 2. Select a guild
 3. Select a channel
 4. Select a directory to save the files
 5. Do other settings if wished
 6. Press the magic button to download stuff
